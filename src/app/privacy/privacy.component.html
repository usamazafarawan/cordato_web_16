                      mobile applications (collectively, the “Website” or “Websites”). Through these Websites we offer various

                    <p>Cordato.com understands that privacy of information is of great importance to our Visitors.</p>
                    <h2>APPLICABILITY OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
                    <p>This Web and Mobile Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes what information Cordato.com collects about
                      Visitors on the publicly available portions of the Websites and how that information is used.</p>
                    <h2>AGREEMENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
                    <p>Your access and use of the Websites is subject to your agreement with this Privacy Policy and the Web and
                      Mobile Terms and Conditions. By using the Website, you expressly agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and
                      consent to the collection and use of information as discussed in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                      Privacy Policy change materially, Cordato.com will give notice to you by posting a notice regarding the new
                      policy on the Websites. The revised Privacy Policy will be effective as of its posting unless otherwise
                      stated.</p>
                    <p>By accessing or using the Website after such changes are posted you agree to all such changes.</p>
                    <h2>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>
                    <p>Either Cordato.com may automatically collect information while Visitors browse the Websites. We may collect
                      such information by tracking, or asking a third party vendor to track, your click-stream activity when such
                      information is not tied to a user ID through the use of "cookie" technology or by tracking internet protocol
                      (IP) addresses, as explained below.</p>
                    <p>Because we want our Websites to better serve Visitors' needs, we collect some basic information about
                      Visitors and their devices, including, but not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
            
                      <li> IP address (the computer’s address on the Internet)</li>
                      <li>Operating system (e.g. Mac OS)</li>
                      <li>Browser software (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari)</li>

                      <li>Dates and time you accessed and used the Website, features you used in the Website, and how long you use
                        the Website overall
                      </li>
                      <li>Links you click and pages you view within the Website</li>
                      <li>Pages you view before and after you leave the Website</li>
            
                    </ul>
                    <p>We use this information to continuously enhance our Websites and to better serve our Visitors’ needs. For
                      example, we use this information to know what browsers people most commonly use, what pages are most often
                      visited, and what functionality is most used. Some of the information we collect from Visitors, such as IP
                      Address, may be considered identifiable personal information (“Personal Information”). Additionally, there are
                      times on our Website that Visitors are able to voluntarily submit Personal Information, such as their name,
                      phone number, and/or email address in order to obtain more information from Cordato.com. We may remove
                      personal identifiers from your Personal Information and maintain and use it in a de-identified form
                      (“De-Identifiable Information”). De-Identifiable Information and Personal Information are collectively
                      referred to throughout this Privacy Policy as “Information”.</p>
                    <p>The Information collected from Visitors on our Websites may be shared with our suppliers and vendors and used
                      in the aggregate to create summary statistics that help us analyze the Websites’ usage trends, assess what
                      information is of most and least importance, determine technical design specifications, arrange the Websites
                      in the most user-friendly way, and identify system performance or problem areas.</p>
                    <p>By continuing to use the Websites, you hereby consent to the use and disclosure of your Information as set
                      forth below:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>within Cordato or with our service providers such as a cloud service provider in the United States for
                        data storage;</li>
                      <li>with our financial, insurance, legal, accounting or other advisors that provide professional services to
                        us;</li>
                      <li>to respond to a subpoena, order, legal process, or government request;</li>
                      <li>to protect, establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</li>
                      <li>to investigate, detect, suppress, prevent or take action regarding illegal or prohibited activities,
                        suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the reputation or physical safety of any person;
                      </li>
                      <li>if we are to be sold, merged, or amalgamated or substantially all of our assets are to be sold or disposed
                        of, your personal information may be transferred to a potential purchaser if, and to the extent necessary,
                        it is required for the purposes of deciding whether to proceed with the proposed transaction and completing
                        it. If such a sale, merger, acquisition, or disposal is completed, we will use reasonable efforts to direct
                        the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with this
                        Privacy Policy. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your
                        personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information; or</li>
                      <li>as otherwise required by law.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>COOKIES</h2>
                    <p>Like many companies, we use “cookies” to help you better navigate the Websites. A “cookie” is a small piece
                      of information sent by Cordato.com web-based applications that are stored by your web browser on your
                      computer’s hard drive. Cookies enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are
                      visiting a particular Website. The cookies do not contain any identifiable information and cannot profile your
                      system or collect information from your hard drive. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but
                      you can set your browser to refuse them or to alert you when they are being sent.</p>
                    <h2>YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
                    <p><strong>Amendment</strong>. You have a right to request that Cordato amend or delete the Personal Information
                      it collects from
                      your use of the Websites if you believe it is incorrect or incomplete, and you may request an amendment or
                      deletion for as long as the Personal Information is retained by Cordato. You must submit your request in
                      writing to Cordato and provide a reason to support the requested amendment. Cordato may, under certain
                      circumstances, deny your request by sending you a written notice of denial.</p>
                    <p><strong>Withdrawal of Consent</strong>. Subject to applicable law, you may withdraw your consent to uses and
                      disclosures of
                      Personal Information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. You must submit your request in writing to Cordato.
                      Withdrawing consent does not invalidate consent to any collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information
                      to which you consented before consent was withdrawn. If you withdraw consent, or refuse further consent,
                      Cordato’s ability to offer services to you may be limited.</p>
                    <h2>HOW TO CONTACT US?</h2>
